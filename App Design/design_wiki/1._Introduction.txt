* **Why are we making this app?**
	Whenever we are browsing the web, we come across sections of it that we wish we could mark as important or remaining. Say a tutorial website, like learncpp.com. There are lots of tutorials out there. We wish to somehow actively bookmark things we've finished, things that are remaining. These **things** are nothing but webpage components.
* **How does this work**
	This service used Google Drive API to save all the bookmarks, in order for them to be ubiquitous, and synched across all devices. Google Drive is a very nice and safe place to store the files. This functionality of Drive is something that is encouraged by Google. This way the service is kept free.
* **How does the app work?**
	The app is a Chrome browser extension.
