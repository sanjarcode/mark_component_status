====== 2. Front-end design ======
Created Sunday 23 August 2020

**Keep it simple**
* Our extension will be used by the user frequently, i.e it is an active extension. So we'd like to have a context menu. This is better than clicking the extension icon. 	This has the following advantages:
	1. No active icon in the extensions bar(Browser is clean)
	2. No need to click the extension icon, this can be hassle as the user would have to go to the icon. Context menu would be better
* For the user who want a click extension icon, we'll support it @later_sometime.
**Context-Menu**
* It will be two stage
* Select the extension first
* Select the status or color next
	A suggestion: We can have the status or color selectable. We won't add steps for the users who want only status(like finished, ongoing etc). 
	**The user will be able to configure the context menu. **So a page is required for proper setup.
* **Initial design: **We'll have the color and status both available.
